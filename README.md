# Introduction
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict housing prices. It explores various algorithms and compares their performance to determine the most accurate model. The project aims to provide insights into factors affecting housing prices and how machine learning can be leveraged for predictive analytics.
# Features
The dataset includes various features, such as:

LotArea - Lot size in square feet.
OverallQual - Overall quality rating.
YearBuilt - Year the house was built.
TotalBsmtSF - Total square feet of basement area.
Refer to the dataset documentation for a full list of features and their descriptions.

# Models
This project explores several machine learning models, including:

Linear Regression: A basic regression model to establish a baseline.
Decision Trees: A non-linear model to capture complex relationships.
Random Forest: An ensemble method to improve prediction accuracy.
Gradient Boosting: An advanced ensemble technique for enhanced performance.
The models are implemented in src/models/ and evaluated for their performance.

# Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as:

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
R-squared Score
The evaluation results are saved in results/.

# Results
The results of the model evaluations are detailed in results/ and include:

Model Performance Summary: A summary of each model's performance metrics.
Visualizations: Graphs and charts illustrating model performance and predictions.
